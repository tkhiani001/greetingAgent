# Python Agent Implementation Guidelines

Python-specific constraints and patterns for implementing Pro-Code AI Agents. Follow these throughout specification execution.

For universal agent patterns, see [guidelines-agent.md](./guidelines-agent.md).

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.13
- Agent framework defined in the `sap-agent-bootstrap` skill
- LangChain 1.0+ / LangGraph
- Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol
- Local execution only (in-memory storage, no deployment)

## Project Structure

- Asset root: `assets/<asset-name>/`
- Required structure: `asset.yaml`, `app/`
- Full layout from project root: `solution.yaml`, `assets/<asset-name>/asset.yaml`, `assets/<asset-name>/app/`
- `asset.yaml` must use `buildPath: .` and `/.well-known/agent.json` for all health probes
- Follow the `sap-agent-bootstrap` skill for project scaffolding — invoke directly from `assets/<asset-name>/`, use copy commands

## Key Constraints

- When working with LangChain or LangGraph, you MUST NEVER use the `create_react_agent` function (`from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent`) as it has been deprecated in LangChain 1.0. Instead, you should use the `from langchain.agents import create_agent` function.
- Only use public APIs; mock any private systems (like S/4HANA) with minimal mock data
- AI Core is available at **runtime** via LiteLLM (environment variables provided at deployment) but is **NOT available during tests** — all LLM calls must be mocked
- No Git operations, no authentication, no documentation/READMEs
- Update `requirements.txt` for any new dependencies
- Never modify `sys.path`
- Map SAP Joule Studio/Skills concepts to standard agent tools
- No `.env` files (environment variables supplied at runtime)

## Code Quality

- All Python code must compile with valid imports
- No `src.` import patterns
- All function parameters must be used in function body

## Agent Decorators

- The bootstrap template already includes decorator scaffolding — no separate skill invocation needed
- **NEVER add new decorated functions to `app/agent.py`** — the five from the bootstrap template (`@agent_model` for primary model, `@agent_model` for fallback model, `@agent_config` for temperature, `@agent_config` for agent memory TTL, `@prompt_section`) are the complete and final set. `@agent_config` is not a general-purpose decorator; it exposes parameters to the SAP platform UI and is intentionally limited to temperature and agent memory TTL. All other values (thresholds, limits, counts, etc.) must be plain Python constants.
- Never mark decorator tasks complete until `sap_cloud_sdk.agent_decorators` imports exist in `app/agent.py`

## Agent Instrumentation (Python Implementation)

- ALL business logic steps MUST be instrumented with proper logging and OpenTelemetry spans
- Use milestones from the PRD's "Milestones" section (if available) or derive from the project input for business step instrumentation
- Each milestone must emit structured log statements on achievement and miss
- Log pattern: `[MILESTONE_ID].[achieved|missed]: [description]`
- Add OpenTelemetry custom spans for each business step using `tracer.start_as_current_span` — use the **decorator form** (`@tracer.start_as_current_span("name")`) on regular async methods, or the **context manager form** (`with tracer.start_as_current_span("name"):`) inside non-generator async functions
- **NEVER use `with tracer.start_as_current_span(...)` as a context manager inside an async generator** (i.e. any method containing `yield`). Doing so causes `ValueError: Token was created in a different Context` when the generator is closed via `GeneratorExit`. For `stream()`, extract all business logic into a plain async helper method (e.g. `_run_agent()`) and instrument that method instead, then call it from `stream()` and yield the result outside any span context.
- Ensure `bootstrap(app)` is called after `app = server.build()` in `main.py`

## MCP Tool Loading (Python Implementation)

For universal MCP patterns, see [guidelines-agent-mcp.md](./guidelines-agent-mcp.md).

### Canonical Pattern

```python
from mcp_tools import get_mcp_tools

async def _load_tools() -> list:
    return await get_mcp_tools()
```

`mcp_tools.py` is the owned indirection layer produced by the bootstrap — import from there, never directly from `sap_cloud_sdk.agentgateway`. This is the target the test fixture patches.

Call `_load_tools()` lazily (not in `__init__`) — it makes network calls. Wire the result into the agent graph:

```python
class MyAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self._tools = None

    async def _get_tools(self) -> list:
        if self._tools is None:
            self._tools = await _load_tools()
        return self._tools

    async def stream(self, query, context_id, ext_impl=None):
        tools = await self._get_tools()
        graph = self._build_graph(tools, system_prompt=get_system_prompt())
        ...
```

### Local Testing (IBD_TESTING)

**Do NOT branch on `IBD_TESTING` in application code.** The `conftest.py` monkey-patches `mcp_tools.get_mcp_tools` before any agent code runs. Agent code stays identical in production and tests.

The patch returns `StructuredTool` instances built from `mcp-mock.json`. Generate `mcp-mock.json` with the `mcp-mock-config` skill before running tests.

## Testing

Working directory for all test operations: `assets/<asset-name>/` (asset root).

### Setup

1. Install test dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-test.txt`

### Boilerplate Files

- `conftest.py` — shared fixtures, custom markers, writes `test_report.json` on full runs
- `pytest.ini` — configures test discovery (`prebuilt_tests/`, `tests/`), default flags, markers
- `requirements-test.txt` — test dependencies
- `prebuilt_tests/` — pre-built structure and server tests; NEVER modify these

### Writing Tests

- All generated tests go in `assets/<asset-name>/tests/` (NOT inside `app/`)
- Unit tests: exactly one per tool; run each immediately after writing
- Integration test: one end-to-end test exercising the full agent graph
- **AI Core / LLM calls MUST be mocked in all tests.** AI Core credentials are NOT available in the test environment. Patch the LLM (e.g. `ChatLiteLLM`) to return canned responses. Never make real network calls to AI Core during tests.
- Mock all external systems (S/4HANA, MCP servers, AI Core) — tests must run offline

### Running Tests

- ALWAYS invoke as just `pytest` from asset root — no paths, no `--cov`, no `--json-report`, no extra flags
- `pytest.ini` configures everything; extra CLI flags conflict with ini settings
- Only exception: targeting a single test: `pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_name`
- Coverage must be ≥ 70%; if below, add targeted tests until threshold met
- Final `pytest` run (no args) MUST produce `test_report.json` — this only happens on full runs without arguments

## Validation Checklist

Run these verifications before marking implementation complete:

```bash
# Instrumentation
grep -r "M[0-9]\.achieved" assets/<asset-name>/app/     # must return results

# Decorators
grep -r "sap_cloud_sdk.agent_decorators" assets/<asset-name>/app/  # must return results
grep -c "^@agent_model\|^@agent_config\|^@prompt_section" assets/<asset-name>/app/agent.py  # must return 5 (two @agent_model for primary and fallback, two @agent_config for temperature and TTL, one @prompt_section)

# Test report
ls assets/<asset-name>/test_report.json                  # must exist
```

## Agent Evaluation (Post-Implementation)

Run after all tests pass and the agent is working locally.

### Step 1: Generate tool schema

Invoke the `sap-aeval-generate-tool-schema` skill from the asset root (`assets/<asset-name>/`). It scans the `app/` directory, extracts all tool function signatures and docstrings, and writes `tools.json` to the current working directory.

### Step 2: Generate eval test cases

Invoke the `sap-aeval-generate-testcase` skill from the same asset root, passing:

- The PRD file path (e.g. `specification/<asset-name>/specification.md`)
- `tools.json` generated in Step 1

The skill writes eval criteria to `aeval/eval.yaml` and YAML test cases to `aeval/testcases/`. Review the generated test cases and replace any placeholder values (e.g. `<param_name:example>`) with realistic data before running evaluations.
